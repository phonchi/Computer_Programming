# Book
This is the companion book for the course [computer programming](https://phonchi.github.io/nsysu-math106A/) open in the Department of Applied Mathematics, National Sun Yat-sen University.
It aims for students who need a basic understanding of procedural programming and object-oriented programming concepts using Python 3. 
We will have hands-on exercises and quizzes to help you get familiar with each topic, and students will exercise logical thinking and programming skills for dealing with scientific problems.

The book is based on several well-known books and resources, including:

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc)
- [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/)
- [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/)
